# Acidify by TeamAcid
## What is Acidify?
Acidify is a tool for building Android builds. It allows easy switching between build types and setting up everything that is needed to build Android.

That said, it is a tool designed for people that are already building Android but want to be able to switch between CM7, CM9, AOKP, etc. easily. It's primarily a convenience tool for TeamAcid developers.
## Can I use Acidify?
Of course you can use Acidify! Be aware that it grabs manifests from us (TeamAcid) so in its unmodified states you'll only be able to build Android the way we build Android.
## What do I need to use Acidify?
Currently, you need a machine running version 10.10 of Ubuntu or higher to use every feature available in Acidify. Until people contribute code aimed at other distributions and versions, some features may be unavailable.
The core features such as initializing the build environment, switching between build types, or building Android itself should theoretically work on any platform running bash and which has all the packages installed that are required to build Android.
## How do I install Acidify
Download a tarball of acidify or clone the repository. Next, put acidify in your PATH. Do this either by putting somewhere already in your PATH (such as ~/bin on many setups), or adding the directory you downloaded or cloned acidify into to your PATH.
